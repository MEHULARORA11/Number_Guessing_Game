🎯 Number Guessing & Prime Analysis System (Java Project)
#🧠 Overview

This Java project is an interactive console-based program that combines number guessing with prime number analysis. It challenges the user to guess a randomly generated number and provides helpful hints, while also analyzing the mathematical properties of the numbers entered.

⚙️ Features

🔢 Random Number Generator: Generates a random number and asks the user to guess it.

🔁 Continuous Loop: The loop continues until the user correctly guesses the random number.

✅ Correct Guess: If the guessed number matches the generated number, the system displays the number.

❌ Incorrect Guess: If the guess is wrong, the system provides hints:

If the guess is too high, it suggests guessing a lower number.

If the guess is too low, it suggests guessing a higher number.

🔍 Prime Number Check: If the input number is prime, the program displays that it’s a prime number.

🧮 Non-Prime Factorization: If the number is not prime, the program prints all its factors.

👯 Twin Prime Check: The program checks if two input numbers are twin primes and confirms if they are.
